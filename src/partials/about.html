          <p class="me-text__descr">Ciao! I’m Tania. I live in Florence and specialize in creating all kinds of events in Italy: from small intimate gatherings to grand corporate events, weddings, and other great occasions, in other words, the sky is the limit. My event boutique runs on a “bespoke” service principle.</p>
          <p class="me-text__descr">I plan and coordinate personalized events with the artistic imagination to the guest’s utter delight and within the client’s reasonable budget. I have been extensively travelling in Italy for over a decade and managed to discover the real gems of this country! I’m always buzzing with energy, enthusiasm and curiosity to get to know more about Italy, its treasures, the best hospitality, catering and other spots it can offer.</p>

            <p class="mission-descr">As your wedding planners, we listen to you and we truly care. We keep you updated throughout the process. We’re generous with our time, schedule regular meetings, and connect you with likeminded suppliers we know you’ll love as much as we do. More often than not we’ll also become really good friends; as getting to know each other socially is, in our opinion, an equally essential ingredient to planning your wedding.</p>
            <p class="mission-descr">And whilst we’ll work closely together in the lead up to your wedding, we wouldn’t be able to do what we do without the creative, exceptionally talented suppliers that support us and your vision. On the day, you’ll find us working alongside each other, as a cohesive team, one step ahead of every detail. Together, we are your personal team of experienced, talented experts, all dedicated to creating and providing you with a wedding like no other.</p>
